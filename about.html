            <p>Mike Industries is the fictional company where Mike Kleinbriel posts all of his blogs. When asked why the word "industries" is in the company's name and not something like the word "blog," Mike had this to say: <em>"Well, I'm just doing this for a class assignment and the example had the word industries in it so I just decided to use that. I then added my name to the company's name just to prove that I didn't copy and paste anything and that I actually typed this all out by hand. Now get out of my sight, I have an About Me to write right now!"</em> Mike Kleinbriel then fired me and I'm now typing this About Me inside a bathroom in my Mom's basement.</p>

            <p>Anyways, Hi! My name is Mike Kleinbriel and I'm the person who made this website. I just finished my first year at Michigan State University and I'm going to be beginning my second year as a Junior (idk how) in the fall of 2023. I'm an aspiring game developer with an emphasis on physics-based VR games and I have some experience with Unity and Unreal. Outside of game development, I do some programming for "fun" which has resulted in me having numerous experiences with HTML, JavaScript, Java, C#, Python, and some C++ experience. I will admit though that I have more experience using the languages on their own and not in a game development context as I only recently started using C# for Unity rather recently and I can only do a couple of things without asking Google for help. I'm also very experienced with Blender as I have been using it since 6th grade and have made numerous models and short films with the program.</p>

            <p>Outside the Technology world, I like to play Tennis and Soccer and sit outside with my dog who is named Thor. I have a brother who is in high school and my parents both have some cool jobs. I like to play video games (very unique, I know) with my friends online and do other stuff with them. My family and I also really like to watch movies and just recently we watched Across the Spiderverse which is a 10/10 masterpiece of a movie. Other than that, I don't really have anything else to say about me. Adios!</p>

            <p>Here are some of my favorite games!</p>

            </ul>
